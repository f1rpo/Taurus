<!-- trs. Original comment:
	"BULL User Settings
	This file is used only when BULL is running without BUG,
	but it will cause no harm to include it with BUG."
	Taurus is bundled with BUG, so we don't need that.
	Will instead use this file for any GlobalDefines that Taurus adds. -->

		 that check. (But it's unlikely that loading will succeed when the

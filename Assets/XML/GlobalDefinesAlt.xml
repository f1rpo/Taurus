	"BULL User Settings
	This file is used only when BULL is running without BUG,

	Taurus is bundled with BUG, so we don't need that.
	Will instead use this file for any GlobalDefines that Taurus adds. -->

		 The string gets written into savegames as the name of the mod.

		 more convenient to use the Ctrl+Shift+S shortcut.) -->

		 savegame. The list can be empty; Taurus will then still be able to load
		 savegames whose mod name matches the name of the folder where Taurus
		 is installed. If LOAD_BTS_SAVEGAMES is also disabled, then loading of
		 savegames works just like in any other mod.

	<!-- Hint: Regardless of the two defines above, the 'x' key be held down
		 while starting to load any savegame to suspend the mod name check
		 in the EXE. This does not affect the SAVE_VERSION check; SAVE_VERSION
		 can be re-defined (iDefineIntVal) in this XML file to work around
		 that check. (But it's unlikely that loading will succeed when the
		 save versions don't match.) -->

	<!-- trs.lma:
		 0 means that the check for the Lock Modified Assets (LMA) game option
		 in the EXE is disabled for all savegames. LMA will then still disable
		 access to developer tools (even if cheats are enabled through
		 CivilizationIV.ini).

		 1 means that the check is disabled for savegames created by other mods,
		 i.e. for savegames that lack a particular bit that the Taurus DLL sets.

		 2 means that the check is always enabled when loading savegames.

		 In any case, LMA is never _written_ into savegames that are exported
		 through Ctrl+Shift+S. For values 1 and 2, LMA _will_ be written into
		 (non-exported) Taurus savegames even if the Save Mod Name option on
		 the Mod Option screen is disabled. (BtS will then be unable to load
		 those saves.)

		 Caveat: When not disabled, the LMA check in the EXE may crash to
		 desktop (instead of merely rejecting a save) when the original assets
		 (BtS/ Warlords/ base game folder) have been modified. Perhaps also when
		 there are custom assets under My Game. This appears to happen due to a bug
		 in the EXE. -->
